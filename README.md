# Modulate-Synth

Modulate! is a modular Max/MSP patch that aims to be a close aproximation (technically and visually) to a physical modular synth.

This patch is built and tested on Max 7 running on OSX

The folder includes:  
Bin folder - All the patches and dependencies  
Readme file  
Century Gothic font for OSX (install this first!)  
2 aliases: One with an example Patch (MODULATE!) and one where it showcases all of the modules (MODULATE! Showcase) - it is recommended to *use only one of them* (because they share the same preset file and midi mapping file)

To create a new modular patch/work one should copy the entire folder (a solution will come up in the future as this is not a desirable aspect but it is the only way up untill now to keep presets and midi mappings separate)
