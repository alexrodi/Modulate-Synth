# Modulate-Synth

Modulate! is a modular Max/MSP patch that aims to be a close aproximation (technically and visually) to a physical modular synth.

This patch is built and tested on Max 7 running on OSX

The provided folder includes:  
Bin folder - All the patches and dependencies  
Readme file  
Manuals folder - A manual file for each module (this is still in progress)  
Run Folder - This zipped folder contains the files to run the patch:  
-Century Gothic font for OSX (install this first!)  
-2 aliases: One with an example Patch (MODULATE!) and one where it showcases all of the modules (MODULATE! Showcase) - it is recommended to **use only one of them** (because they share the same preset file and midi mapping file)

To create a new modular patch/work one should copy the entire folder (a solution will come up in the future as this is not a desirable aspect but it is the only way up untill now to keep presets and midi mappings separate)


Notice: the Run folder MUST be unzipped using the OS X compression utility to maintain the integrity of the files (it is for this exact reason that the folder is zipped to begin with)
