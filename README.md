# Modulate-Synth

Modulate! is a collection of modules and a main patch for Max/MSP that aims to be a close approximation, both technically and visually, to a physical modular synth.

This is the source code, but there is a [release version](https://github.com/alexrodi/Modulate-Synth/releases/tag/v1.1)
