# Modulate-Synth

Modulate! is a modular Max/MSP patch that aims to be a close aproximation (technically and visually) to a physical modular synth.

This patch is built and tested on Max 7 running on OSX

The provided folder includes:  
-Install MODULATE.pkg - this installs all patches and dependencies in Max's library  
-Readme file  
-Manuals folder - A manual file for each module  
-2 MODULATE! patches: One with an example Patch (MODULATE!) and one where it showcases all of the modules (MODULATE! Showcase)  

Because presets and MIDI mappings are created in the same folder as the patch, **different patches should not share the same folder.**
